# TBD
### Fixed
* Set Hive replica table metadata to ignore header in replicated CSV files. See [#12](https://github.com/HotelsDotCom/circus-train-bigquery/issues/12)

# 2.0.0 - 2018-07-13
### Changed
* Updated project to be compatible with Circus Train 12.0.0 and up
* Improved error logging when extraction job fails or is no longer present.
* Extract table during replication rather than in listener to prevent silent failure. See [#5](https://github.com/HotelsDotCom/circus-train-bigquery/issues/5).

### Changed
